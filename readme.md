# MULTIUSER-GPU-APP-DEPLOYMENT
Our aim is to deploy an existing GPU-accelerated application, app.py, in a manner that ensures scalability, the capability to handle heavy traffic, and aligns with professional product deployment practices for multi-user access.
Here's an overview of the solution in bullet points. 
After each bullet point we will be testing the last state of the 
application with all the added features

# 1.First cycle 
## 1.1 App Modernization (local development)

- **Run your already existing app.py and take notes of system and GPU loads**
- **Abstract the Data Access Layer** Ensure your application interacts with its data storage, cache, and any external state through an abstract data access layer. This means your application code should not directly call specific databases or caching systems. Instead, use interfaces or abstract classes that can be implemented for different backends
- **Create mocks to use with Data Access Layer and connect them**
- **Test if the app logic is working without any problems**
- **Redesign your app.py in a way to use env variables as feature flags**(local, cloud, test, prod...)
- **Design an api and create a basic documentation** 
- **Wrap it with fastapi**
- **Create simple tests for api calls and app logic**
- **Use postman test if all systems are working**
- **Implement Celery to manage tasks asynchronously**
- **Use Redis**  to manage the queue of tasks that Celery will process.
- **use postman test if all systems are working**

## 1.2 Deployment Readiness  (local development)
- **Run a Redis container locally to mimic Memorystore and a PostgreSQL container as a stand-in for Cloud SQL**
- **Connect the Data Access Layer to mock_redis and mock_cloud_SQL containers**
- **Add basic CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and container image building**
- **Containerization with GPU Support**
- **Test the container app**
 
## 1.3 Staging Deployment 
- **Create a DockerHub and GCP account**
- **Create Memorystore, PostgreSQL accounts** (if needed)
- **Rebuild the container with correct environment variables and feature flags**
- **Upload your container to dockerhub**
- **Create compute engine(VM) instance in GCP**
- **Install docker in this VM**
- **Pull the app inside the VM and run it**
- **Test if all is okay with postman**


# 2. Second cycle
- **Implement IaC (terraform)**
- **Enhanced CI/CD pipeline to include IaC deployment with Terraform**
- **Deploy on GCP using terraform**

# Third cycle
- **Deploy on GKE using terraform**
- **Refine CI/CD process to support deployments to GKE using Terraform**









- **FastAPI for API Development**:
  - Utilize FastAPI to build the API, benefiting from its asynchronous handling capabilities.
  - FastAPI will serve as the entry point for all incoming requests to the Stable Diffusion app.

- **Celery for Asynchronous Task Management**:
  - Implement Celery to manage tasks asynchronously, allowing for efficient GPU task processing without blocking incoming API requests.
  - Celery workers will handle the heavy lifting of processing requests on the GPU.

- **Redis or RabbitMQ as Celery's Message Broker**:
  - Use Redis or RabbitMQ to manage the queue of tasks that Celery will process. This acts as the intermediary between the API and the task workers.
  - This broker facilitates the distribution of tasks to Celery workers and helps in scaling by adding more workers as needed.

- **CUDA for GPU Resource Management**:
  - Employ CUDA for direct control over GPU resources, ensuring efficient task execution and resource utilization.
  - This will be used by the Celery workers to process tasks on the GPU.

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. **Set Up FastAPI**: Code the API using FastAPI, defining endpoints for submitting and managing requests.
  2. **Set Up Celery**: Implement Celery with either Redis or RabbitMQ as the broker to handle tasks asynchronously.
  3. **Integrate CUDA**: In the Celery tasks, utilize CUDA for GPU-based processing, leveraging libraries like `cupy` or `pycuda`.
  4. **Process Requests Asynchronously**: When a request is received, FastAPI enqueues a task in Celery and immediately responds to the user. The Celery worker then processes the task using GPU resources.
  5. **Respond to Users**: After processing, the results can be made available to the users through a callback, polling, or another method suitable for the application's architecture.

- **Running the System**:
  - Start the message broker (Redis or RabbitMQ).
  - Launch the Celery worker(s) to listen for tasks.
  - Serve the FastAPI application, handling incoming requests and delegating processing tasks to Celery.

This solution ensures that your Stable Diffusion app's backend can handle multiple requests concurrently, efficiently utilizing GPU resources without forcing users to wait in a queue.
