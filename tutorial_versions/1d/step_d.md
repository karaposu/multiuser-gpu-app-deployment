 

so, one big question is what to test. we want to focuse on initialization tests for components related
-configuration files,
-network services, or
-hardware resources,

since these points are where software more likely to fail.  

can software read the config file?
can it connect to bigquerry storage? 
can it find the path for model?
does attached GPU being recognized by the service?

and creating these tests we are effectively creating a solid foundation for further testing and operation. These tests can quickly pinpoint issues related to the environment setup, which is particularly valuable because:

**Early Detection of Integration Issues:** Ensuring that dependencies are correctly integrated and operational from the start can prevent more complex issues later in the application lifecycle. This is especially true for components that interact with external systems or rely on specific configurations.
**Stability and Reliability:** By verifying that the initial state of your components is correct, you enhance the overall stability and reliability of your application. It ensures that subsequent operations are performed on a well-established base.
**Efficient Debugging:** When a problem arises, having confidence in the initialization process allows you to narrow down potential issues more efficiently. Knowing that the setup process is not the cause can save significant time and effort in debugging.


for starts these tests are sufficient. But with every significant improvement in the code base we will add more tests.
