Abstracting the Data Access Layer

Steps:

1. Identify the distinct data-related operations in your application logic, such as data caching, data inputs, and data outputs.

2. Create abstract classes using the `ABC` module to define interfaces for each distinct data operation.

3. For each abstract class, define abstract methods using the `@abstractmethod` decorator to represent the generic operations. These methods will be implemented by concrete subclasses.

4. Implement concrete classes that inherit from the abstract classes. These classes provide specific implementations for the abstract methods, catering to different scenarios (e.g., local storage, cloud storage).

In the context of our application, we can identify three interfaces (`ImageStorage`, `ModelLoader`, and `TextStorage`) each with distinct data-related use cases and methods. 
The goal is to provide a common interface for these operations, allowing flexibility in implementation details (e.g., local storage vs. cloud storage) and enabling future changes or additions to the underlying storage or model loading mechanisms.

First of all, for the simplicity we dont want to store the generated images. 
Once image is generated we will use base64 encoding to encode it and send it as post request answer 

and our app uses a special funciton for model loading inside the nodes.py called "CheckpointLoaderSimple"
CheckpointLoaderSimple Remains Focused on Its Task: It continues to be responsible for loading models from checkpoint files, potentially including additional processing like guessing configurations, and handling specific model types such as VAE and CLIP. It would not need to be directly concerned with where those checkpoint files are stored (local filesystem, cloud storage, etc.).
The only difference is we will create a concrete implementation of loadmodel (loadlocalmodel) to use the CheckpointLoaderSimple. 


ImageStorage interface :
- localstorage 
- cloudstorage 
ImageStorage methods:
- save_image
- retrieve_image
ModelLoader interface: 
- localstorage 
- cloudstorage 
ModelLoader methods:
- load_model

TextStorage interface:
- localstorage 
- cloudstorage 
TextStorage methods:
- save_text
- retrieve_text


LocalModelLoader: This class knows how to interact with local storage to find model files. When it needs to load a checkpoint, it delegates the task of actually loading and configuring the model to CheckpointLoaderSimple, providing it with the path to the checkpoint file.
CloudModelLoader (Hypothetical): If you had a cloud-based storage solution, this class would know how to interact with that cloud storage to locate model files. Like LocalModelLoader, it could use CheckpointLoaderSimple to handle the complexities of loading the model once the file is accessible.



This abstraction not only allows for easier integration with different storage providers (e.g., GCP, AWS) but also promotes modularity and flexibility in your application architecture. It aligns with the principles of decoupling components and creating independent layers, which can be beneficial for future modifications, containerization, and scalability.
