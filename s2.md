Abstracting the Data Access Layer

Steps:

1. Identify the distinct data-related operations in your application logic, such as data caching, data inputs, and data outputs.

2. Create abstract classes using the `ABC` module to define interfaces for each distinct data operation.

3. For each abstract class, define abstract methods using the `@abstractmethod` decorator to represent the generic operations. These methods will be implemented by concrete subclasses.

4. Implement concrete classes that inherit from the abstract classes. These classes provide specific implementations for the abstract methods, catering to different scenarios (e.g., local storage, cloud storage).

In the context of our application, we can identify three interfaces (`ImageStorage`, `ModelLoader`, and `TextStorage`) each with distinct data-related use cases and methods. The goal is to provide a common interface for these operations, allowing flexibility in implementation details (e.g., local storage vs. cloud storage) and enabling future changes or additions to the underlying storage or model loading mechanisms.

ImageStorage interface :
- localstorage 
- cloudstorage 
ImageStorage methods:
- save_image
- retrieve_image
ModelLoader interface: 
- localstorage 
- cloudstorage 
ModelLoader methods:
- load_model

TextStorage interface:
- localstorage 
- cloudstorage 
TextStorage methods:
- save_text
- retrieve_text



This abstraction not only allows for easier integration with different storage providers (e.g., GCP, AWS) but also promotes modularity and flexibility in your application architecture. It aligns with the principles of decoupling components and creating independent layers, which can be beneficial for future modifications, containerization, and scalability.
