i will be using comfyui to create a stable diffusion image generaiton app. Once we have a workflow we will save the workflow
and then use :
https://github.com/pydn/ComfyUI-to-Python-Extension

convert it to no-gui python code. 

then we move the .py file to comfyui directory 
and also we need to change a small thing. by default it generates 10 images. we just need 1.  Lets edit that

and lets run it. 
it works without any problem.
